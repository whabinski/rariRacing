A School Culminating Project

The game I developed served as my final project for a web development class, specifically targeting grade 2 and 3 students. The core objective was to create an educational tool that enhances math skills in young learners. Throughout the development process, I followed a structured software development lifecycle. The result is a game that not only aligns with academic standards but also offers an enjoyable learning experience for children at a crucial stage in their educational journey.
